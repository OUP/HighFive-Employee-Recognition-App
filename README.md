# HIGH FIVE - Employee Recognition Web Application

## Project Description 

Project High Five is a multilayered web application that helps employees within an organization streamline peer recognition, feedback and Slack integration. Businesses that use Slack will love the integration. Itâ€™s easy for users to adopt and for the businesses to begin seeing employee engagement increase.

Employees can send and receive points, feedback based on their performance, engagement and management around their day-to-day activities, projects, team intiatives involved within the organization. Based on the available points employees can also redeem them to purchase gift cards, invest in professional development courses and contribute to local charities.

## Deployment

For development/poc purposes, there is an example CloudFormation template to
provision a server running nginx and postgresql and an associated Capistrano
configuration to deploy the react front end and the rails api to the server.

This is not intended for production use, and is not well-documented, but if you
know your way around Capistrano and CloudFormation you should find it easy to
create the stack, configure your ssh credentials, and deploy the applications.

As the Capistrano config deploys both the react front end and the rails api to
the same server, it is stored in the root of the project/repo. You will need to
`bundle install` and `cap development deploy` within project/repo root.


## Slack Integration Setup

Please refer to Slack API documentation for additional information: https://api.slack.com/

* a Slack team would need to be created as well as a Slack App to handle functionality

### Slash Command

* Reqeust URL needs to be defined with route to handle, including /slack 'route' for the web app to handle the request from Slack user
* App 'Verification Token' needs to be stored in .env file to authenticate requests sent to the route
* Current configuration accepts one slash command /points -> to received a mesage back of how many points a user has.


### Sending Notifications to Users on web app events | uses api/chat.postMessage
